    <h1>11 Comae Berenices b</h1>
    <p>11 Comae Berenices b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a G-type star. Its mass is 19.4 Jupiter masses, it takes 0.89 years to complete one orbit of its star, and is 1.29 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2007.</p>
    <p>This planet is particularly interesting due to its high mass, which places it close to the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Its relatively short orbital period for such a massive planet also makes it an intriguing target for studies of planetary formation and migration.</p>
    <img src='https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/214_HD_108147_b_Art.jpg'>
    <h2>11 Comae Berenices b is one of the most massive known exoplanets.</h2>
    <p>With a mass of 19.4 Jupiter masses, it's among the heaviest planets discovered, bordering on brown dwarf territory. This makes it an important object for understanding the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs.</p>
    <h2>The planet orbits its star in less than a year.</h2>
    <p>Despite its large mass, 11 Comae Berenices b completes an orbit in just 326 days. This is a relatively short period for such a massive planet, suggesting it may have migrated inward from where it formed.</p>
    <h2>11 Comae Berenices b orbits a yellow-white dwarf star.</h2>
    <p>The host star is more massive and hotter than our Sun, classified as an F-type subgiant. This makes the planetary system quite different from our own.</p>
    <h2>The planet was discovered using the radial velocity method.</h2>
    <p>Like many exoplanets, 11 Comae Berenices b was found by detecting the wobble it causes in its parent star's motion. This method is particularly effective for finding massive planets like this one.</p>

    <h1>14 Andromedae b</h1>
    <p>14 Andromedae b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a K-type star. Its mass is 4.8 Jupiter masses, it takes 186 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.83 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2008.</p>
    <p>This planet is notable for its orbit, which is nearly circular, unlike many other known exoplanets. This characteristic makes it an interesting target for studies of planetary formation and evolution.</p>

    <h2>14 Andromedae b has an almost circular orbit.</h2>
    <p>Unlike many exoplanets which have highly elliptical orbits, 14 Andromedae b's orbit is nearly circular. This is unusual for a planet of its mass and proximity to its star.</p>
    <h2>The planet orbits a K-type orange giant star.</h2>
    <p>14 Andromedae, the host star, is larger and cooler than our Sun. It has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core and has expanded and cooled off, becoming an orange giant.</p>
    <h2>14 Andromedae b is in the "Goldilocks zone" of its star.</h2>
    <p>Despite being much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, the planet is in the habitable zone because its star is cooler. However, as a gas giant, it's unlikely to harbor life as we know it.</p>
    <h2>The system is relatively old.</h2>
    <p>The 14 Andromedae system is estimated to be about 4.3 billion years old, making it slightly younger than our solar system.</p>

    <h1>Kepler-452b</h1>
    <p>Kepler-452b is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-452. It has a radius about 1.6 times that of Earth and completes an orbit around its star every 384.8 days. Its discovery was announced in 2015.</p>
    <p>This planet is particularly interesting because it's the first near-Earth-size world to be found in the habitable zone of a star very similar to our Sun. Its star is 1.5 billion years older than our Sun, giving a preview of what might happen to our planet in the distant future.</p>
    <img src='https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/2288_kepler452b_artistconcept_2.jpg'>
    <h2>Kepler-452b is often called Earth's "older cousin".</h2>
    <p>The planet is about 60% larger in diameter than Earth and is considered a super-Earth-size planet. While its mass and composition are not yet determined, previous research suggests that planets of this size have a good chance of being rocky.</p>
    <h2>The planet orbits a G2-type star, similar to our Sun.</h2>
    <p>Kepler-452 is 6 billion years old, 1.5 billion years older than our Sun. It has the same temperature, and is 20% brighter and 10% larger in diameter.</p>
    <h2>Kepler-452b is in the habitable zone of its star.</h2>
    <p>The planet is at a distance from its star where liquid water might pool on the surface. However, scientists are not sure if Kepler-452b can support life as we know it.</p>
    <h2>The planet has a hypothetical moon: Kepler-452b I.</h2>
    <p>While no moon has been detected around Kepler-452b, scientists speculate that such a large planet in the habitable zone could potentially host a moon. This hypothetical moon has been named Kepler-452b I in our visualization.</p>

    <p>Kepler-186f is a rocky exoplanet that orbits an M-dwarf star. Its radius is about 1.11 times that of Earth, and it takes 129.9 days to complete one orbit of its star. It is located about 582.5 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Its discovery was announced in 2014.</p>
    <p>This planet is particularly interesting because it's the first Earth-sized planet discovered in the habitable zone of another star. Its reddish appearance is due to the light from its cooler, redder host star.</p>
    <img src='https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/2288_kepler452b_artistconcept_2.jpg'>
    <h2>Kepler-186f is often referred to as a "cousin" of Earth.</h2>
    <p>The planet is very close in size to Earth and orbits within the habitable zone of its star. This means it could potentially have liquid water on its surface, although this hasn't been confirmed.</p>
    <h2>The planet orbits an M-dwarf star, much cooler and redder than our Sun.</h2>
    <p>Kepler-186 is about half the size and mass of our Sun. It's much cooler, which gives Kepler-186f its characteristic reddish hue when viewed from space.</p>
    <h2>Kepler-186f receives about one-third of the energy from its star that Earth gets from the Sun.</h2>
    <p>Despite being in the habitable zone, the planet receives much less light and heat than Earth. This could mean that if it has an atmosphere similar to Earth's, its surface might be more like Mars - cold, dry, and with large ice caps.</p>
    <h2>The planet has two hypothetical moons: Kepler-186f I and Kepler-186f II.</h2>
    <p>While no moons have been detected around Kepler-186f, scientists speculate that such a planet could potentially host moons. These hypothetical moons have been named Kepler-186f I and Kepler-186f II in our visualization.</p>

    <h2>24 Bootis b is a "hot Jupiter".</h2>
    <p>It orbits very close to its star, completing an orbit in just over a month. This proximity means the planet is likely tidally locked, with one side always facing its star.</p>
    <h2>The planet orbits an evolved star.</h2>
    <p>24 Bootis, the host star, is a K-type giant star. It has exhausted the hydrogen in its core and has expanded and cooled off, becoming a giant star.</p>
    <h2>24 Bootis b has a nearly circular orbit.</h2>

    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <p>Venus, the second planet from the sun, is named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet — the only
        planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her pantheon because it shone
        the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers.</p>
    <p>In ancient times, Venus was often thought to be two different stars, the evening star and the morning star — that
        is, the ones that first appeared at sunset and sunrise. In Latin, they were respectively known as Vesper and
        Lucifer. In Christian times, Lucifer, or "light-bringer," became known as the name of Satan before his fall.
        However, further observations of Venus in the space age show a very hellish environment. This makes Venus a very
        difficult planet to observe from up close, because spacecraft do not survive long on its surface.</p>
    <img src='https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2014/2-whatistheave.jpg'>
    <h2>A day on Venus lasts longer than a year.</h2>
    <p>It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis (sidereal day). The planet's orbit around the Sun takes 225
        Earth days, compared to the Earth's 365. A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) takes 117 Earth days.</p>
    <h2>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets.</h2>
    <p>This means that Venus is rotating in the opposite direction to the Sun, this is also know as a retrograde
        rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused the
        planet to alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar systm by having no
        natural satellites.</p>
    <h2>Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky.</h2>
    <p>Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during
        daytime on a clear day.</p>
    <h2>Atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth's.</h2>
    <p>While its size and mass are similar to Earth, the small asteroids are crushed when entering its atmosphere,
        meaning no small craters lie on the surface of the planet. The pressure felt by a human on the surface would be
        equivalent to that experienced deep beneath the sea on Earth.</p>

    <h2>The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing.</h2>
    <p>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although
        the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it
        happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased
        to 25 hours.</p>
    <h2>The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.</h2>
    <p>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted
        that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it.
        Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is
        also not the case.</p>
    <h2>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</h2>
    <p>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field
        protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</p>
    <h2>There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.</h2>
    <p>As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in our solar

    <h2>Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass.</h2>
    <p>Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth's volume and just over 10% of the Earth's mass, around two thirds of
        the Earth's surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth's (meaning you could
        leap nearly three times higher on Mars).</p>
    <h2>Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar systm.</h2>
    <p>Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, is 21km high and 600km in diameter. Despite having formed over billions of years,
        evidence from volcanic lava flows is so recent many scientists believe it could still be active.</p>
    <h2>Only 18 missions to Mars have been successful.</h2>
    <p>As of September 2014 there have been 40 missions to Mars, including orbiters, landers and rovers but not counting
        flybys. The most recent arrivals include the Mars Curiosity mission in 2012, the MAVEN mission, which arrived on
        September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization's MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived
        on September 24, 2014. The next missions to arrive will be the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission,
        comprising an orbiter, lander, and a rover, followed by NASA's InSight robotic lander mission, slated for launch
        in March 2016 and a planned arrival in September, 2016.</p>
    <h2>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar systm.</h2>
    <p>They can last for months and cover the entire planet. The seasons are extreme because its elliptical

    </p>
    <p>Jupiter helped revolutionize the way we saw the universe and ourselves in 1610, when Galileo discovered Jupiter's
        four large moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, now known as the Galilean moons. This was the first time
        that celestial bodies were seen circling an object other than Earth, major support of the Copernican view that
        Earth was not the center of the universe.</p>

    <h2>The ancient Babylonians were the first to record their sightings of Jupiter.</h2>
    <p>This was around the 7th or 8th century BC. Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. To the Greeks, it
        represented Zeus, the god of thunder. The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of the city of
        Babylon. Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar, or Thor.</p>
    <h2>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets.</h2>
    <p>It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving
        it an oblate shape.</p>
    <h2>Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years.</h2>

    </p>
    <p>Saturn is the farthest planet from Earth visible to the naked human eye, but it is through a telescope that the
        planet's most outstanding features can be seen: Saturn's rings. Although the other gas giants in the solar systm

    <p>It is named for the Roman god Saturnus, and was known to the Greeks as Cronus.</p>
    <h2>Saturn is the flattest planet.</h2>
    <p>Its polar diameter is 90% of its equatorial diameter, this is due to its low density and fast rotation. Saturn
        turns on its axis once every 10 hours and 34 minutes giving it the second-shortest day of any of the solar
        systm's planets.</p>
    <h2>Saturn orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years.</h2>

    <p>British astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus accidentally on March 13, 1781, with his telescope while
        surveying all stars down to those about 10 times dimmer than can be seen by the naked eye. One "star" seemed
        different, and within a year Uranus was shown to follow a planetary orbit.</p>

    <h2>Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781.</h2>
    <p>It is too dim to have been seen by the ancients. At first Herschel thought it was a comet, but several years
        later it was confirmed as a planet. Herscal tried to have his discovery named "Georgian Sidus" after King George
        III. The name Uranus was suggested by astronomer Johann Bode. The name comes from the ancient Greek deity
        Ouranos.</p>
    <h2>Uranus turns on its axis once every 17 hours, 14 minutes.</h2>
    <p>The planet rotates in a retrograde direction, opposite to the way Earth and most other planets turn.</p>
    <h2>Uranus makes one trip around the Sun every 84 Earth years.</h2>
    <p>During some parts of its orbit one or the other of its poles point directly at the Sun and get about 42 years of
        direct sunlight. The rest of the time they are in darkness.</p>
    <h2>Uranus is often referred to as an "ice giant" planet.</h2>
    <p>Like the other gas giants, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium mixed in. Below that is an icy
        "mantle, which surrounds a rock and ice core. The upper atmosphere is made of water, ammonia and the methane ice
        crystals that give the planet its pale blue colour.</p>

    <h1>Neptune</h1>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun. It was the first planet to get its existence predicted by mathematical
        calculations before it was actually seen through a telescope on Sept. 23, 1846. Irregularities in the orbit of
        Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest that the gravitational pull from another celestial body
        might be responsible. German astronomer Johann Galle then relied on subsequent calculations to help spot Neptune
        via telescope. Previously, astronomer Galileo Galilei sketched the planet, but he mistook it for a star due to
        its slow motion. In accordance with all the other planets seen in the sky, this new world was given a name from
        Greek and Roman mythology — Neptune, the Roman god of the sea.</p>
    <p>Only one mission has flown by Neptune – Voyager 2 in 1989 – meaning that astronomers have done most studies using
        ground-based telescopes. Today, there are still many mysteries about the cool, blue planet, such as why its
        winds are so speedy and why its magnetic field is offset.</p>

    <h2>Neptune was not known to the ancients.</h2>
    <p>It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed in 1846. Its position was determined using mathematical
        predictions. It was named after the Roman god of the sea.</p>
    <h2>Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly.</h2>
    <p>Its equatorial clouds take 18 hours to make one rotation. This is because Neptune is not solid body.</p>
    <h2>Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants.</h2>
    <p>Despite being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. Below its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is made of
        layers of hydrogen, helium, and methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, ammonia and methane ice. The inner
        core of the planet is made of rock.</p>
    <h2>The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane.</h2>
    <p>The methane absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear a lovely blue. High, thin clouds drift in the upper
        atmosphere.</p>

    <h1>Pluto</h1>
    <p>Pluto, once considered the ninth and most distant planet from the sun, is now the largest known dwarf planet in
        the solar systm. It is also one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a shadowy zone beyond the orbit
        of Neptune thought to be populated by hundreds of thousands of rocky, icy bodies each larger than 62 miles (100
        kilometers) across, along with 1 trillion or more comets.</p>
    <p>In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely thought of as a demotion. The question of
        Pluto's planet status has attracted controversy and stirred debate in the scientific community, and among the
        general public, since then. In 2017, a science group (including members of the New Horizon mission) proposed a
        new definition of planethood based on "round objects in space smaller than stars," which would make the number
        of planets in our solar systm expand from 8 to roughly 100.</p>

    <h2>Pluto is named after the Greek god of the underworld.</h2>
    <p>This is a later name for the more well known Hades and was proposed by Venetia Burney an eleven year old
        schoolgirl from Oxford, England.</p>
    <h2>Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.</h2>
    <p>This is when the IAU formalised the definition of a planet as “A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit
        around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a
        hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.”</p>
    <h2>Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930 by the Lowell Observatory.</h2>
    <p>For the 76 years between Pluto being discovered and the time it was reclassified as a dwarf planet it completed
        under a third of its orbit around the Sun.</p>
    <h2>Pluto has five known moons.</h2>
    <p>The moons are Charon (discovered in 1978,), Hydra and Nix (both discovered in 2005), Kerberos originally P4
        (discovered 2011) and Styx originally P5 (discovered 2012) official designations S/2011 (134340) 1 and S/2012
        (134340) 1.</p>
